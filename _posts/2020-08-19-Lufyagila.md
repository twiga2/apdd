Poultry health is imperative for the continued growth of poultry and increased production. Environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and Ammonia gas impact the health of the poultry; whereby, they can affect the respiratory system and eventually cause death. In Tanzania, most farmers use charcoal and kerosene stoves to control these parameters as they have limited access to economical, secure, and user-friendly poultry house monitoring systems. However, such traditional methods are not environmentally friendly, unreliable, difficult to manage, and inaccurate. Therefore, this study proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) based system for environmental conditions monitoring in the poultry house. The proposed system saves time and labor costs as the farmer can monitor and control the parameters mentioned above securely, reliably, and remotely. 
The study also proposes an algorithm to allow the system to work online and offline (i.e., synchronizing with the cloud server when the Internet access is available).
