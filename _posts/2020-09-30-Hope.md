Poultry farming is economically significant as it supports up to 4.6 million households in the country. Different factors lead to low poultry productivity, devastating diseases being the major problem. Coccidiosis, Newcastle and Salmonella diseases have led to severe losses to the farmers. Majority of the farmers practice traditional farming located in peri-urban areas and do not have a systematic way to collect information related to disease diagnostics. This ongoing work aims to develop an automated tool that will contribute to early detection of the diseases using Deep Learning. We have so far visited poultry farmers in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions, collecting poultry data including fecal images from both healthy and unhealthy chicken and information on poultry management. The image dataset has been preprocessed and trained on two baseline models VGG 16 and Resnet 50 for binary classification. We then applied transfer learning on other Convolutional Neural Network architectures including MobileNet, XceptionNet, Resnet and VGGNet using our dataset of the three class labels. The expected outcome of this study is to have a tool for robust diagnostics of the three diseases that will help reduce the losses farmers incur due to the diseases. Additionally, the study will produce an annotated dataset for poultry diseases diagnostics that can be used for further research.
